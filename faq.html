                    <p>This page has been added to act as an addition help source for our users, below is a list of common questions that we have taken the liberty to answer for you. If you cannot see the answer to a question you are looking for on here, please do not hesitate to ask one of our dedicated staff members because thats what they are there for. If you believe your question should be listed on this page, please contact management in-game.</p>

                    <h4>Can i be staff?</h4>
                        <p class="news-update">Long story short, no. To ensure a happy and stable playing environment the management ensure that the process of hiring new members to become part of the team be an in-depth lengthy one. If Staff applications have not been posted and you wish to be hired, just be yourself and helpful to other new members, make other peoples playing experience just as good as your own. Asking for staff will not only make yourself look foolish but also destroy your chances of ever getting that top job in the future.

                    <h4>Do i get any benefits for inviting my friends?</h4>
                        <p class="news-update">Of course, inviting people to our server is one of the main sources of our popularity, it helps us expand larger as a community thus making the server more fun. Its strongly recommended that you invite people to the server because does it not only score you DIAMONDS but it makes you look good to the management, it shows us that you have potential to go further than just a standard in-game user.                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>What are the benefits from voting?</h4>
                        <p class="news-update">Money, money and more money. As said above, voting and iniviting ar the main sources of population on our server so its strongly recommended that you vote for the server on a daily basis and invite as many friends as possible. Voting for the server will get you $350 In-game dollars per vote, theres currently 8 different sites you can vote on, thats $2800 per DAY if you cast a vote on all sites on a daily basis. </p>

                    <h4>I got griefed, Help!?!</h4>
                        <p class="news-update">Basically theres nothing we can do for you here, BizCraft is a factions server which ALLOWS the act of PVPing and Griefing. If your base gets griefed by an enemy faction or a fellow user the only thing we can suggest is to pick yourself back up and carry on mining! Its not the end of the world, you can learn from your mistakes, thats the whole point of the game. If you want advice on how to protect your valuables read the Q&A Below.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Can i protect my valuables?</h4>
                        <p class="news-update">Yes, of course! Basically all you need to do is create a faction and claim the land your chests/base is in. You can do this by doing the following commands in-game, "/f create (name)" followed by "/f claim". This will protect the land you are standing on, preventing anyone from just walking into your base and taking your stuff, it will actually require some effort from people to do so. Now, even though the land has been claimed it is still possible for people to access your goods, although you can't place anything on land that isnt yours people can still attack it from a distance, so keep that in mind when constructing your base.</p>
